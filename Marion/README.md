## Abstract  

The **definition of bioimage analysis** given on the website of [NEUBIAS](http://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/), the european network of bioimage analysts is the following: "Bioimage analysis focuses on the quantitative measurement of biological systems by processing multidimensional image data. It hence aims at being as objective as possible in measuring Bioimages and estimating the underlying numerical parameters of the biological systems they capture, independently of human observation."        

In other words, bioimage analysis aims at answering biological questions by extracting numerical data from images of biological systems and analysing these data. Once numerical values are extracted from the multidimensional image data, the data analysis starts. The first step is to summarize these data into new images, the graphical representation. The popular say "an image is worth a thousand words" is relevant here, as complex information is summarized into a compact communication medium, the graph. However, graphical representations follow the conventions and unspoken rules of data visualization. Morever, our graphicacy, i.e. our personnal ability to present and understand a graph, depends on our knowledge of these conventions, but also on our cultural background. All this strongly influence our perception of the information contained in the graph. This session aims at giving a brief overview of major concepts in data visualization and to encourage bioimage analysts to pay attention to their choices of graphical representations.
