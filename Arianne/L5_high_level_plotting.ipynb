    "\n",
    "[HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/) is an excellent high-level plotting package that can use Bokeh to render plots. In my view, it is one of the best high-level plotting languaes in the Python plotting landscape. We will work with HoloViews in a future lesson, but in this lesson, we will do our high-level plotting using a package I wrote called [Bokeh-catplot](https://github.com/justinbois/bokeh-catplot).\n",
    "\n",

    "- It does not natively make ECDFs.\n",
    "- Its definition of a box plot is non-canonical ([my fault](https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/1926), but will soon be [fixed](https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/pull/3755)).\n",
    "- It does not (easily, or as far as I can tell) enable an axis with more than one categorical variable for strip plots (though it does for box plots).\n",
    "- It has a [bug when making horizontal strip plots](https://github.com/pyviz/holoviews/issues/3748).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are all relatively minor fixes for HoloViews, which will likely have this functionality in the near future.\n",
