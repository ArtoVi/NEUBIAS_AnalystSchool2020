# NEUBIAS Bioimage Analyst School 2020

Dates: Feb. 29 - Mar.3, 2019
Place: Bordeaux

Organizers: Marion Louveaux & Kota Miura

## Aim

The aim of NEUBIAS Bioimage Analyst School is to provide **bioimage analysts** with practical access to the latest bioimage analysis workflows and their components [1]. Many tools for bioimage analysis are updated and new ones are appearing on daily basis, but analysts tend to be constrained to what one knows already. They are too busy to test and use all those new tools. We hope that this school will be a good chance for analysts to test something new by the exposure to workflows and their components, and also to widen their scope and broaden their skills. In addition to this primary aim, the school also aims for the community buidling amond bioimage analysis experts - it's always good to have friends with similar interests!

The program is evolving every year. The program in Bordeaux is designed based on the experiences in three prvious schools in Lisbon (2017), Szeged (2018) and Luxembourg (2019). As many of the participants commented that we need to have more modules with statistical treatments of data, we will have a stronger focus on those aspects in this school, especially in the context of recent announcements from the statistics community [2-4].  The school is followed by a half-day "**BioImage Analyst Satellite Meeting**", accepting more participants than the school, where bioimage analysts exchange practical information and discuss in a non-formal interactive sessions.

The school is based on the concepts of "workflows and components" in bioimage analysis ([more details here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-22386-1_1)) and will be with four types of modules: **Workflow Deconstruction**, **Advanced Usage of Workflow Components**, and **Implementation**. 

In **Workflow Deconstruction**, we reproduce, trace and modify bioimage analysis workflows. Invited author of the selected workflow present the bioimage analysis workflow in details: the biological problem, algorithms of components including statistical analysis, how they are assembled into the workflow to output either numbers, plots or visualization results. In parallel with these explanations, participants will load those components and reproduce the workflow on their own laptop (reproduce the workflow). Interactive discussion on following points will be moderated.

- Used components and algorithms
- The overall design of the workflow
- Reuse of certain component blocks for different biological problems
- Capability of running the workflow in various environments 

This year, [John Doe)]() will guide us through the Workflow in the following paper:

- The paper
  - John Doe
  - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0518-z

In **Advanced Usage of Workflow Components**, invited experts present in-depth explanation about workflow components, and explain effcient access to the API (We call this **API-beating**). This training is aiming to encourage participants to expand their skill and technique to utilize cutting-edge components in their workflow they construct in future. 

This year we will learn about:
- TBA
- TBA
- TBA

In **Implementation**, participants are split into several groups, and each group implements one of the following issues:

1. Modification of workflows presented in the school, for either 
   1. the full workflow running in different ecosystems
   2. a part of the workflow replaced with a different component. 
2. Comparison and benchmarking of workflow components with similar algorithms. The target components should be selected by each group.

## Participation Requirements

Participants are expected to be bioimage analysts, analyzing biological image data on daily basis. 

Please bring your own laptop! We do not provide machines.  

We expect some fluency in at least one programming language. We do not teach coding, but intensively do coding using several different languages. Skills / flexibility to follow such sessions are a prerequisite. Specific workflow organizers will however provide some 'homework' to prepare for their module, containing leads to learn a language and prepare for the installation of the required softwares on your laptop.

**There will be no helpers during all sessions. ** We rather promote attending bioimage analysts to to help each other, also for the networking.

During registration, the applicant is asked to submit at least one bioimage analysis workflow that one has authored / worked on (starting with a specific biological question, describe the workflow in a short paragraph and the type of results: numbers, plots and/or visualization - does not have to be a published paper). Among these applicants, some are selected for presentation as "Workflow Deconstruction" session and lead the session. 

## Workflow Deconstruction: Details

- Invited Author: - 
- Details of [Preparation and Homeworks]()
- Concepts

   - Tracing the workflow, starting with sample image data, understand the biological problem, do image processing and data analysis, ends up in numbers, plots or visualizations. 
   - Explanation for each step (or each component) are given and interesting algorithms are picked up and discussed in details. 
   - Each participant uses ones own laptop to reproduce / modify the workflow
   - Interactions: questions on components, a proposal for alternative solutions, discussion on capability in other ecosystems. 
   - Invited "workflow authors" + Selected "workflow authors" from applicants (registration form should include an abstract of submission of interesting workflow)


## Advanced Workflow Components: Details


###  Topic 1

- TBA

### Topic 2

  ...

## Workflows, Student Presentations

Some workflows submitted by participants during registration will be selected for presentation during the school. 


## Implementations / Presentations

School participants are asked to present their implementations (by group) on the last day of the school. 7 groups, 15 minutes presentation + 5 minutes questions and answers. 

 

## Time Table

Below is the  schedule from the last year: It will be replaced.
